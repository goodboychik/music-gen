# Generation of Music using Recurrent Neural Networks 
### 1. Introduction
This project aims to develop a model capable of generating music using Recurrent Neural Networks RNN). The project will focus on creating and training a neural network to generate sequences of notes or musical features by learning patterns in musical compositions. The final output will be AI-generated music that mimics the structure, harmony, and rhythm of training datasets consisting of various music genres.
